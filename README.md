I am in the ultimate year of Master of Engineering, at the University of Melbourne. I have more than 1-year of experience in mechanical design as well as software development obtained from getting involved in different projects related to robotics and autonomous systems over my course and internship experience. I consider myself as a 'forever student', eager to both build on my academic foundation in Mechatronics and upskill myself in Computer Science with online courses. I am currently working on my capstone project while also self-learning web development in part-time. I am seeking for opportunities to kickstart my career path in Robotics and Software Development after graduate.

### Some projects that I have got involved into:
- Developed software pipeline for the autonomous warehouse robot using ROS, Python and C++
- Designed the 4-dof robot arm for moving the chess piece
- Working on designing and implementing the autonomous steering system for the FSAE-A Electric car
- Maintained and developed additional feature in C++ for the temp-humid sensor transmitting data to a gateway by LoRa network
- Assisting ALEX team (UniMelb) on embedded system of the crutch and exoskeleton
